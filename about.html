            <p>Roughly towards the end the last decade, education began changing, and so did the ways through which it was imparted started to undergo a paradigm shift as well. Today, education is at the brink of bursting its conventional bubble and careering its way towards becoming completely technology-oriented. But, it isn’t just education that’s changing. Every element of the education ecosystem is undergoing a similar kind of change. Parents are turning out to be more demanding, students are becoming smarter, and educators that constitute an important element of the education ecosystem, also are bringing a lot of changes in the teaching techniques, and in the education approach as a whole. Education is evolving. Therefore educators too must evolve to keep up with this new-age revolution.</p>

                <h1>Who are we?</h1>
                <p>It is these positive changes within the educational ecosystem that propelled the inception of CITIS Educon in 2012! Led by Mr. Harshad Sangle, a modern-age, responsible and dynamic education professional, CITIS joined the education revolution with a vision to better education, and help educators across the education spectrum to adopt smarter and more technology-based practices, and introduce technology certifications to first – keep up with the modern-age dynamics of education, and second – to ensure that students become future-ready through imperative technology certifications.</p>

              <p>
                As teachers constitute an important and the most fundamental element of education, it all starts from helping teachers align and upgrade their skills to meet the modern-age demands of students and parents, and education as a whole. CITIS works towards developing the technological, strategic, and teaching skills of K-12, college and university teachers. To-date CITIS has consulted several educators on teacher development and helped a lot of teachers in upgrading themselves and become smarter and quicker through technology training sessions, soft skills training sessions, and others based on the needs. Here, the focus is on comprehensive development, rather than developing only technical skills.
